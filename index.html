            <h4>about me:</h4>
            <p>I work as programmer <b>PHP</b> for 3 year in STiM (Brest).
                I serve CMS system <b>Bitrix</b> in our company.<br>
                I am administrator, business analyst and programmer in one face.
                Three years ago the company management <br> chose *ERP* system for company. I and two my colleagues
                wrote temporary system, witch allowed partially <br> fulfill the necessary functions. Our system
                worked for 2 years. Now it is changed with <i>1C ER</i>. <br> Our system was built on 3 products
                interaction between which was was carried out using <b>SOAP</b> services. <br> My part was made on
                <b>Bitrix</b>.
                Now company actively working with <i>1C</i>. It is not very interesting for me. <br> I want to work as
                <b>WEB engineer</b>. It is the reason I came to study for <i>RS school</i>.<br>
                I am persistent, easily trained, communicable.
